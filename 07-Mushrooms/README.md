# Mushrooms

If you eat the wrong one, you die.
So if you're building a classifier, it is more important than normal
that you can control the error rates of the model. I'd rather have a
program reject an edible mushroom than allow a deadly one.

This project will be more about investigating the relationship between
type 1 and type 2 errors, and including information about the confidence
of model predictions than it will be about building the most powerful
model.
